A personal ray tracer project.

Planned features include
* Standard raytrac-y things: reflection, shadows, transparency
* support for rendering multiple frames for an animation
* photon mapping
* OpenCL/threading for computation
* network communication to enable multiple machines to work on one output image
* kd-tree based intersection algorithm
* powerful file representation of scenes and objects
